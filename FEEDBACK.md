## Feedback on AI-Assisted Development
For this task, approximately 90% of the work was completed with the help of AI tools. The AI was used to generate and refine the core functionality of the application, including the logic for controllers, services, entities, and repositories.

My manual contribution focused on:

Configuring the application.properties file for MySQL and Hibernate setup.

Writing and adjusting test cases.

Manually configuring some URLs and application-specific endpoints.

Overall, the AI greatly accelerated the development process, allowing me to focus on integration, testing, and configuration.
